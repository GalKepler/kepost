	abstract = {A modified and extended version, HCPex, is provided of the surface-based Human Connectome Project-MultiModal Parcellation atlas of human cortical areas (HCP-MMP v1.0, Glasser et al. 2016). The original atlas with 360 cortical areas has been modified in HCPex for ease of use with volumetric neuroimaging software, such as SPM, FSL, and MRIcroGL. HCPex is also an extended version of the original atlas in which 66 subcortical areas (33 in each hemisphere) have been added, including the amygdala, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, mammillary bodies, septal nuclei and nucleus basalis. HCPex makes available the excellent parcellation of cortical areas in HCP-MMP v1.0 to users of volumetric software, such as SPM and FSL, as well as adding some subcortical regions, and providing labelled coronal views of the human brain.},

	abstract = {The human hippocampus is involved in forming new memories: damage impairs memory. The dual stream model suggests that object “what” representations from ventral stream temporal cortex project to the hippocampus via the perirhinal and then lateral entorhinal cortex, and spatial “where” representations from the dorsal parietal stream via the parahippocampal gyrus and then medial entorhinal cortex. The hippocampus can then associate these inputs to form episodic memories of what happened where. Diffusion tractography was used to reveal the direct connections of hippocampal system areas in humans. This provides evidence that the human hippocampus has extensive direct cortical connections, with connections that bypass the entorhinal cortex to connect with the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex, with the temporal pole, with the posterior and retrosplenial cingulate cortex, and even with early sensory cortical areas. The connections are less hierarchical and segregated than in the dual stream model. This provides a foundation for a conceptualization for how the hippocampal memory system connects with the cerebral cortex and operates in humans. One implication is that prehippocampal cortical areas such as the parahippocampal TF and TH subregions and perirhinal cortices may implement specialized computations that can benefit from inputs from the dorsal and ventral streams.},
